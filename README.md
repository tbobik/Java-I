# Java-I

### Description
Various homework assignments I completed during my Java I class.

### HomeWork 1- StudentRecord
Discription: Define and use a class for the student record. The class should have instance variables for the quizzes, midterm, and final only. Overall numeric score for the course (0 - 100 represents weighted average of students work). Your class is required to have the set of accessor and mutator methods, full constructor, default constructor, equals method, and a toString method.
  The tester program should read in the student's scores and output the student's record (should all be done in your main method), as well as the student's overall numeric score for the entire course and final letter grade. Must validate user input and handle errors appropriately.

### HomeWork 2- Rock, Paper Scissors, Lizard, Spock
Discription: A tester that creates two HandGamePlayer objects (default constructor for cpu, full constructor for human), play for 3 rounds by asking the user for a choice of sign (1-5 now), outputting the two players sign, and outputting who won. Once all rounds are done, output the stats and declare the winner.
