# Java-I

### Description
Various homework assignments I completed during my Java I class.

### Rock, Paper Scissors, Lizard, Spock
Discription: A tester that creates two HandGamePlayer objects (default constructor for cpu, full constructor for human), play for 3 rounds by asking the user for a choice of sign (1-5 now), outputting the two players sign, and outputting who won. Once all rounds are done, output the stats and declare the winner.
